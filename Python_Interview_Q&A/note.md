Inversion of Control (IoC):

Libraries follow the principle of "use when needed."
Frameworks often follow the principle of "don't call us; we'll call you," meaning that the framework controls the flow of the application.

Whether it's a library or a framework, both are installed locally on your laptop using a package manager like pip. The key distinction lies in how you use them and the level of control they exert over your application's architecture and flow.


A Python framework can either be full-stack, micro, or asynchronous.

Form generators, form validation, and template layouts are usually available with a typical full-stack framework.
