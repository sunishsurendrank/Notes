## Java SE  vs JRE  vs JDK 

Java is a platform. It consists of two products - the software development kit, and the runtime environment.
- Java SE - "Java Standard Edition"
    - JDK - Java Development Kit
    - JRE - Java Runtime Environment
- Java EE - "Java Enterprise Edition"
- Java ME - "Java Mobile Edition"


To run a Java application someone else provides you need JRE.
To develop a Java application you need JDK.
Next for developers download JDK not JRE. JDK will contain JRE. 

Starting with Java v1.5:
- v5 = v1.5.
- v6 = v1.6.
- v7 = v1.7.
